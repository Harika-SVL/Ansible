## Introduction

* Used for the applications which is accessed globally .
* Written once and applicable over various os flavours (servers too) .
* When frequent updates to be made into all the systems used in an organisation .

## Deployment options 

![Alt text](shots/1.PNG)

* We can have mainly two deployment approaches :
1. Declarative approach
2. Procedural approach

* Configuration management is the declarative deployment which ensures :
1. Idempotence : Run this once or n times you will have same result 
2. Desired state : We express configuration to acheive a desired state 
3. Reusable

## Configuration Management (CM)
* There are two types :
1. PULL based configuration
2. PUSH based configuration

### PULL based Configuration Management :
* Communication direction => Node to CM server

* Required : 
=> Agent needs to be installed with necessary credentials to connect to CM Server

* Popular tools :
=> chef
=> puppet

### PUSH based Configuration Management :
* Communication direction => CM Server to Node

* Required :
=> List of nodes (inventory)
=> Credentials to login into node

* Popular tools :
=> Ansible
=> SaltStack

# Ansible

## Architecture and Workflow
* Basic workflow

![Alt text](shots/9.PNG)

* Here the control node can execute desired state on nodes using
=> adhoc commands
=> playbooks (YAML files)

## How organisations work over multiple sever scenerio

* They have many a servers and admins
* And creating individual logins for each of them is not possible/feasible
* So, they create a service account for the admins to login and perform administration

![Alt text](shots/10.PNG)

* Let's our service accountâ€™s name  be devops
* Having username and password is not a sensible way so we use keypair based authentication

## Key pair authetication using RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
* In this we generate two keys (i.e., public and private) of some mathematical prime number calulations

=> Public key : It comprises of two numbers, in which one number is the result of the product of two large prime numbers. This key is provided to all the users.

=> Private key : It is derived from the two prime numbers involved in public key and it always remains private. 


* To create a keypair use : 'ssh-keygen' command
